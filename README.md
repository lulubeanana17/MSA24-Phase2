MSA24 phase 2 - individual project by Siyoon Jung


Introduction
- My individual project was inspired by my work experiences in hospitality. Through my 4 years hotel careers, I have frequently faced communication problems between departments. It was hard to assign jobs to departments by traditional methods, such as radio, as it might not reach or signal loss. Some experiences told me that using chat, such as Whatsapp, can be a solution. However, it can sometimes cause leak of guests information.

About the App
- My application offers a customised communication app for hotels. The functions are simple; Generate and Receive. The app consists of two pages, which are Post a job and Browse jobs.

1. Post a job
   - An administrator can generate a job, set a urgency (within some time it must be done), and assign a department on the job. It confirms the details on Review page with them and post it.
   
3. Browse jobs
   - Anyone who have access can see the jobs. each request cell shows the title, location, startTime, urgency, assigned department, and status (Not started, In Progress, Completed). When you enter the job, you can see the more details of the selected job and can revoke, start, or complete the job by clicking the buttons.


One thing about your project you are very proud of
- I am proud of that I was not lazy at all to learn new technologies. I used to postpone what I need to know until it requires me to do. However, I actively tried to learn new things, such as ASP .NET, C#, Redux ..etc, and acomplished what I wanted to have at the end of the project. I really appreciate to the MSA team for this opportunity.

- Regarding the technoligy wise, I am proud of my file structure. When I started frontend development 3 year's ago, I did not have a structure and did not know what it is. However, through many projects and collaborating with many people, I know how to structure the file organisation and keep it clean for other developers.
